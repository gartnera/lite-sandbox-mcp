Please complete the following Go project workflow:

1. Run 'go mod init testproject' to initialize a Go module
2. Create a file main.go with:
   - A package main
   - A simple Add function that takes two ints and returns their sum
   - A main function that calls Add and prints the result
3. Create a file main_test.go with:
   - A package main
   - A test function TestAdd that verifies Add(2, 3) returns 5
4. Run 'go test ./...' to verify the test passes
5. Run 'git init' to initialize a git repository
6. Run 'git add .' to stage all files
7. Run 'git commit -m "initial commit"' to create the first commit

Use the Write tool to create files and the bash_sandboxed tool for commands.
Show me the results of the go test and git commit commands.
